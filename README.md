## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/0eUO2xK1/cleaning-management)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/We-Got-This-Cleaning-app-76cc96c45f8e42b39db24be87ead78f8)

[UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/IYZo7sHGDjXcPbXu5uf3qN/Untitled?node-id=434%3A0)

The app will be a database that stores information regarding business operations and will allow managers and technicians to store records about their work.

### Key Features

-   Scheduling jobs for customers
-   Integrating with Google Calendar
-   View customers information
-   Filter jobs by zip code
-   Uploading checklist/pictures related to job
-   Add and edit customers
-   Assign jobs to teams

## Tech Stack Summary

### Front end built using:

#### React

-   React is a library for building composable user interfaces. It encourages the creation of reusable UI components.

#### Redux

-   Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments.

#### Formik

-   Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts: getting values in and out of form state, validation and error messages, and handling form submission

#### Material UI

-   React components for faster and easier web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design.

#### Front end deployed to `Zeit Now`

# APIs

## Firebase

Firebase is a platform to assist in the rapid development of websites that don't need to worry about a backend. It is for this reason we chose to use this API.

# Testing

Cypress was used for testing because it has a unique suite that lets you visualize tests and their results.

# Installation Instructions

Execute `yarn` in the project folder.

## Other Scripts

`yarn run cypress open` opens the Cypress testing suite.

### Attribution

These contribution guidelines have been adapted from [this good-Contributing.md-template](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426).

### Known Defects

-   Recurring only creates the same event weekly
-   The login does work - you have to create a user via google and then re-load the page after you accept all the conditions during the user creation
-   Google calendar is integrated into the app, but job events are passed down to teams and not team members
